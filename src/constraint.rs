//! Traits for constraining values that variables can take

use super::assignment::Assignment;
use std::fmt::Debug;

/// A constraint that affects given variables in a system\
/// A given constriant can be satisfied by multiple possible assignments.
///
/// ## Invariants
///
/// 1. if `self.variables().count() == 0`, then `self.size() == 1`\
///    i.e. if a constraint affects no variables, it should have 1 solution, the empty solution
/// 2. if `this.variables().count() > 0`, then `this.decompositions().count() >= 1`\
///    i.e. if a constraint affects any variables, it should have at least 1 decomposition
///
/// ## Formal definition
///
/// Formally, a constraint is a set of possible assignments for the variables within a problem.
///
/// For example, in a minesweeper game:
/// - the variables would be `[x, y]` positions for a tile
/// - the values to assign would be `true`/`false` for whether a mine is in a tile
///
/// And a possible constraint could be:
/// ```json
/// {
///   { [2, 3]: true, [3, 3]: false },
///   // position [2, 3] is a mine
///   // position [3, 3] is safe
///
///   // or
///
///   { [2, 3]: false, [3, 3]: true },
///   // position [2, 3] is safe
///   // position [3, 3] is a mine
/// }
/// ```
pub trait Constraint {
    /// The type of variables assigned by the Constraint
    type Var;
    /// Any solution to a Constraint
    type Solution: Assignment;
    /// The error raised when 2 constraints conflict with each other
    type ConflictErr: Debug;

    /// An approximation to the number of unique assignments that `self` has.
    ///
    /// This doesn't *have* to be exact, but should at least:
    /// - `return 1` when there's only one unique solution
    /// - `return 0` when no solutions are possible
    fn size(&self) -> usize;

    /// All variables that `self` affects
    fn variables(&self) -> impl Iterator<Item = Self::Var>;

    /// Possible decompositions for this constraint.
    ///
    /// A decomposition is a constraint that:
    /// 1. affects a subset of `self.variables()`
    /// 2. has a single unique solution that `self` allows
    ///
    /// ## Returns
    ///
    /// An iterator over the possible decompositions of `self`
    fn decompositions(&self) -> impl Iterator<Item = Self>;

    /// Removes the overlap between another constraint and this one.\
    /// This is useful as it lets us remove uncertainty from the system\
    /// and make it simpler to solve.
    ///
    /// ## Arguments
    ///
    /// - `other`: the other constraint to attempt reduction with
    ///
    /// ## Returns
    ///
    /// Whether `other` successfully reduced `self`,\
    /// or a conflict error if `other` conflicts with this constraint.
    ///
    /// Constraints conflict if there's **no** assignment that satisfies both.
    fn reduce(&mut self, other: &Self) -> Result<bool, Self::ConflictErr>;

    /// Pops all variables that have a unique assignment in this constraint
    fn pop_solution(&mut self) -> Option<Self::Solution>;
